						<p>Currently a student / mentee / learner at Perpetual Education, learning all about the wonderful world of web design and development. Ultimately my goal is to obtain a job as a front end or back end web developer.</p>

						<p>This is my "business card" site used as a portfolio of sorts to showcase the work that I am currently working on or have finished.</p>

						<p>It is a constant work in progress and will be updated as more projects are completed. So stay tuned!</p>
