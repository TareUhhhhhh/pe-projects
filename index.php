		<h2>Also a little info <em>about</em> Tara</h2>

		<p>Currently a student/mentee/learner at Perpetual Education, learning all about the wonderful world of web design and development. Ultimately my goal is to obtain a job as a front end or back end web developer.</p>

		<p>This is my "business card" site used as a portfolio of sorts to showcase the work that I am currently working on or have completed.</p>

		<p>It is a constant work in progress and will be updated as more projects are completed.</p>
