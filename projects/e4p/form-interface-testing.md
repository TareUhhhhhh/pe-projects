# Forms Testing

## Andy
	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?
		Easy to find at the expected location
	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		There is a brief explanation of the point of this site

		- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
			Intro/purpose written out
		- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
			Yes
		- 	Does the form work? Can you break it?
			They work and didn't seem to be breakable
		- 	Do things jump around when you interact with them?
			The page info jumps down because of the array display at the top. It's cool to see that data though.
		- 	Is the outcome clear?
			Yes
		- 	Do the form styles match across all forms?
			Yes
		- 	Is it a pleasure to use?
			Yes
		- 	What could be improved?
			Maybe put the array info at the bottom so it doesn't push down the page. Also either adding a link back to the index or have each form open in a new tab.

		Easy to find at the expected location.
	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		A brief explanation of the "57 Exercises" could be helpful -- but the mysteriousness kind of goes along with the ransom note looking style

		- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
			A description of the form would be nice. Why am I entering my name? Why do I need to add an input string?
		- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
			Iputs are lagible, but the label overlaps the input once it is typed. Could use some spacing.
		- 	Does the form work? Can you break it?
			The forms work but it could be helpful to give a message saying that an input is required if I click the button without typing anything.
		- 	Do things jump around when you interact with them?
			The button jumps a bit on hover, but it doesn't move anything and doesn't seem to act broken. It just grows and seems intentional.
		- 	Is the outcome clear?
			Yes
		- 	Do the form styles match across all forms?
			Yes
		- 	Is it a pleasure to use?
			Yes the styling is fun!
		- 	What could be improved?
			The thing mentioneed above with overlapping inputs and message when nothing is entered

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p?
		Easy to find at the expected location
	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		There could be a description as to what this forms practice is for or where the information is comign from

		- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
			There is a "title/h1" that seems to explain what the form is intended for
		- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
			Yes - the input boxes seem a bit small and the labels could also be a bit larger for more legibility
		- 	Does the form work? Can you break it?
			They work and don't seem to break
		- 	Do things jump around when you interact with them?
			No
		- 	Is the outcome clear?
			Since the information is diplayed at the bottom, sometimes after the page reloads it seems like something is broken because I need to scroll down to see it.
		- 	Do the form styles match across all forms?
			Yes
		- 	Is it a pleasure to use?
			Yes
		- 	What could be improved?
			Some of the forms provide an output with null values, where it might be better to say "Hey you gotta enter some information here!"

		I could not

		I could not

## Ned
	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p?
		Easy to find at the expected location
	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		A small intro with a description of the purpose of the forms could be useful. The links to the forms seem kind of small also

		- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
			A description to explain what the forms do and what the inputs mean would be helpful
		- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
			Yes
		- 	Does the form work? Can you break it?
			The client contact message area has a default message in it that the user would need to backspace. That message should probably be a placeholder attribute instead. Also some of the number fields shouldn't allow for negative values
		- 	Do things jump around when you interact with them?
			No
		- 	Is the outcome clear?
			The berry counter doesn't seem to have an output
		- 	Do the form styles match across all forms?
			Yes
		- 	Is it a pleasure to use?
			The padding feels a little big, but that can be nice sometimes. I like the :hover state of the button
		- 	What could be improved?
			Replacing some of the default messages with placeholders. Adding a button to take the user back to the index, or opening in a new tab. Also adding required fields so that they couldn't be submitted with no info

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p?
		Found it, but it isn't in the projects folder!
	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		A description of the purpose of this page would be helpful - also names for each link so we know what we are clicking on

		- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
			Some of them -- not the berry counter
		- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
			Yes
		- 	Does the form work? Can you break it?
			I broke the berry form with negative numbers
		- 	Do things jump around when you interact with them?
			No
		- 	Is the outcome clear?
			The berry form didn't explain what the result meant
		- 	Do the form styles match across all forms?
			Yes
		- 	Is it a pleasure to use?
			Yes
		- 	What could be improved?
			The items mentioned above, also adding a button to go back to the index or opening the pages in new tabs
