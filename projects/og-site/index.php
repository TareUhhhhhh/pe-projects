						<p>Currently attending <a href="https://perpetual.education/">Perpetual Education</a>, learning all about the wonderful world of web design and development. Ultimately my goal is to obtain a job as a front end or back end web developer.</p>

						<p>This is my "business card" site used as a portfolio of sorts to showcase the work that I am currently working on or have finished.</p>

						<p>It is a constant work in progress and will be updated as more <a href="projects.php">projects</a> are completed. So stay tuned!</p>
