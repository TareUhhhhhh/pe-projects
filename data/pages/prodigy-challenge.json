				"Thanks to the good old Internet always paying attention to what we do, I stumbled across a Seven-Day Digital UX/UI design challenge. Having learned a bit about UX/UI in my bootcamp, I figured it could be helpful to complete the challenge and learn a bit more.",
				"I truly think that a developer can only be more valuable from having a solid understanding of the concepts that go into creating web designs. (Plus, major bonus, then I've got plenty of my own Figma designs that I can use myself to practice and build out my portfolio!)",
				"So below are the projects featured in the challenge. I will include the Figma link to my creation for each design, as well as a link to the site I actually created based off of the Figma file, when applicable. The very first design, for example was literally just creating a search bar. Not much to build out from that one."

				"The first challenge was to recreate the Booking.com search bar. It's a pretty small and simple challenge, but it's an easy start for day 1!",
				"While this is just for a search bar and not enough to create a new page, it was a great addition for my responsive layout garden."
