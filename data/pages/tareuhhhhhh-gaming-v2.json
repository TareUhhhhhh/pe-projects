				"This project was an exercise in emulating a theme. I like playing video games, specifically I really enjoy horror games, so I researched video game companies that specialize in that genre. I studied them and looked for any similarities and repeated elements.",
				"My site features scrolling parallax background images, which was an inspiration from Bloober Team. They also feature linkes that appear to be oversized buttons with a simple border and no background, which is a style I liked, so I wanted to incorporate that.",
				"The Supermassive Games website tends to show more similarities because the inspiration I drew from that site anchors everything together. I chose a very similar font and very thin font weight. I also emulated the hover underline they have for their header nav bar."
