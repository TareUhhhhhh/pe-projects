				"This project is meant as an ever-growing collection of responsive layouts that are functional on all screen sizes. The inspiration can come from anywhere. Some of them are pretty basic overall and exist as a reference. Sometimes inspiration can come from a website that I found. Even real life can have cool and unexpected sources of inspiration.",
				"The more points of inspiration I can find, the more I can grow this garden of modules. Then it's great to use for future projects as ideas for page layout design."
