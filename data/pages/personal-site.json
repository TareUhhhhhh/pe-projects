				"Rather than using an existing, premade template to plug in my words, I have built this site for myself from the ground up. From mood boards and style tiles and MANY layout iterations made in Affinity Designer, this website is the result of my own mind and work. While it may evolve over time, this is its current state!",
				"The background designs are also of my own making with Affinity Designer. While I don't consider myself a graphic designer, I do enjoy using Affinity as a creative outlet! I didn't feel the need to throw a design on all pages, as some of them had plenty of content to see and choose to look at.",
				"I chose to default my site to dark mode style, since it reflects me more accurately. Anywhere that dark mode is an option, I have it. My life is dark mode, so why wouldn't my site be??"
