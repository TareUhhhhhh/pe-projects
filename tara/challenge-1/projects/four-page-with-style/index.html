						<p>Well, it's as simple as you clicked a link or typed this URL into your browser.  Not to go into a long story of how the internet works, but this info is actually stored on a remote computer and you are just accessing that information to be displayed in your own browser.  Pretty neat, huh?  You can call me "Web Master Tara" if you like.  <i>Even if you don't like, you still can. ;)</i></p>

Check out below for interesting stuff and feel free to explore.</p>
