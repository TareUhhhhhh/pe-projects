<p>A vacation is when you take a trip to some <?php echo $adjective; ?> place
with your <?php echo $adjectiveTwo; ?> family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an <?php echo $noun; ?> or up on a/an <?php echo $nounTwo; ?>.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride <?php echo $nounThree; ?>s
or play <?php echo $game; ?> or go hunting for <?php echo $nounFour; ?> . I like
to spend my time <?php echo $verb; ?>ing or <?php echo $verbTwo; ?>ing.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating
three <?=$nounFive?> a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around <?=$verbThree?>ing. Last summer, my little brother
fell in a/an <?=$nounSix?> and got poison <?=$plant?> all
over his <?=$bodyPart?>. My family is going to go to (the)
<?=$place?>, and I will practice <?=$verbFour?>ing. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
<?=$adjectiveThree?> and because they have to work <?=$number?> 
hours every day all year making enough <?=$nounSeven?>s to pay
for the vacation.</p>
