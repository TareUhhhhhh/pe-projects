					<h1>Custom Properties Exercise</h1>

					<h2>I am using this page to try out custom CSS properties.</h2>

					<h3>Reasons to use custom properties:</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Easily use branded colors throughout a site.</li>
						<li>Easily update theme colors in CSS throughout the whole document.</li>
						<li>Use media query for light/dark modes.</li>
						<li>Keep consistent padding!</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>More Info</h2>

					<p>Custom Properties in CSS feel a little bit "wild west" on the surface. A bit elusive even on first look.</p>

					<p>"What do you mean I can do ANYTHING with a custom property!? You mean like making the whole browser up and fly away? Or create a new color or function entirely?"</p>

					<p>Well, I don't know about all of that, but it makes consistency much more achievable. Also more easily updated. <span>For example, if a brand has Purple, Green and Blue as their main colors, you could put them throughout your CSS stylesheet and go on about your day, but when they want to update and go more "designer" and change up to a nice lavender shade, a teal and a cyan, you are going to have to hunt down every last example of that throughout the CSS and make those changes one at a time.</span></p>

					<p>Or...set up your custom properties. Main color, highlight, neutral, dark, fancy, dull...whatever descriptors make sense for each situation. Then you've got one spot you can update those colors and you're set.</p>

					<p>It's really pretty amazing when it clicks. Anything that increases ease and efficiency is an A+ in my novel!</p>
